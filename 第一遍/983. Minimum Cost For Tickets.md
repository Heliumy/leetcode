## 题目

In a country popular for train travel, you have planned some train travelling one year in advance.  The days of the year that you will travel is given as an array days.  Each day is an integer from `1` to `365`.

Train tickets are sold in 3 different ways:

- a 1-day pass is sold for `costs[0]` dollars;
- a 7-day pass is sold for `costs[1]` dollars;
- a 30-day pass is sold for `costs[2]` dollars.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.  For example, if we get a 7-day pass on day 2, then we can travel for 7 days: day 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.

Return the minimum number of dollars you need to travel every day in the given list of `days`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: days = [1,4,6,7,8,20], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 1.
On day 3, you bought a 7-day pass for costs[1] = $7, which covered days 3, 4, ..., 9.
On day 20, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2, which covered day 20.
In total you spent $11 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: days = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,30,31], costs = [2,7,15]
Output: 17
Explanation: 
For example, here is one way to buy passes that lets you travel your travel plan:
On day 1, you bought a 30-day pass for costs[2] = $15 which covered days 1, 2, ..., 30.
On day 31, you bought a 1-day pass for costs[0] = $2 which covered day 31.
In total you spent $17 and covered all the days of your travel.
```

**Note:**

1. `1 <= days.length <= 365`
2. `1 <= days[i] <= 365`
3. `days` is in strictly increasing order.
4. `costs.length == 3`
5. `1 <= costs[i] <= 1000`

## 讲解

又是一道动态规划的题啊，现在已经非常适应递归的写法了，感觉很简单自然，但是递归最大的坏处就是性能低。我这里依旧用了规模自顶向下的递归的方式 + 备忘录。总的来说不是特别熟练，花了点时间。但已经能做到独立的分析并解决了。
