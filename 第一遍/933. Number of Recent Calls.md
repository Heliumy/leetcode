## 题目

Write a class `RecentCounter` to count recent requests.

It has only one method: `ping(int t)`, where t represents some time in milliseconds.

Return the number of `ping`s that have been made from 3000 milliseconds ago until now.

Any ping with time in `[t - 3000, t]` will count, including the current ping.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: inputs = ["RecentCounter","ping","ping","ping","ping"], inputs = [[],[1],[100],[3001],[3002]]
Output: [null,1,2,3,3]
```

**Note:**

1. Each test case will have at most `10000` calls to `ping`.
2. Each test case will call `ping` with strictly increasing values of `t`.
3. Each call to ping will have `1 <= t <= 10^9`.

## 讲解

这道题最重要的是看懂题，每个ping都附带一个时间点，求这个时间点往前3000毫秒内的ping数量。这里我使用了一个队列来实现。

## Java代码

```java
class RecentCounter {
    
    private Queue<Integer> queue;

    public RecentCounter() {
        queue = new LinkedList<>();
    }
    
    public int ping(int t) {
        while(queue.size()>0 && queue.peek()<t-3000){
            queue.poll();
        }
        queue.offer(t);
        return queue.size();
    }
}

/**
 * Your RecentCounter object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * RecentCounter obj = new RecentCounter();
 * int param_1 = obj.ping(t);
 */
```
