## 题目

Suppose you have **N** integers from 1 to N. We define a beautiful arrangement as an array that is constructed by these **N** numbers successfully if one of the following is true for the $i_th$ position (1 <= i <= N) in this array:

1. The number at the $i_th$ position is divisible by **i**.
2. **i** is divisible by the number at the $i_th$ position.

Now given N, how many beautiful arrangements can you construct?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 

The first beautiful arrangement is [1, 2]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 1, and 1 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=2).

The second beautiful arrangement is [2, 1]:

Number at the 1st position (i=1) is 2, and 2 is divisible by i (i=1).

Number at the 2nd position (i=2) is 1, and i (i=2) is divisible by 1.
```

**Note:**

1. **N** is a positive integer and will not exceed 15.

## 讲解

典型的回溯法题目，回溯的实现其实就是简单的递归+循环，需要注意的点是状态的切回。比如这一题，visited数组在不同的深度会有不同的状态。在回溯返回的时候要把状态还原。

## java代码

```java
class Solution {
    private int result = 0;
    public int countArrangement(int N) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[N];
        explore(N, 1, visited);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void explore(int N, int pos, boolean[] visited){
        for(int i=1;i<=visited.length;i++){
            if(visited[i-1]==false && (i>=pos && i%pos==0 || i<pos && pos%i==0)){
                visited[i-1] = true;
                if(pos==N){
                    result++;
                    visited[i-1] = false;
                    return;
                }
                explore(N, pos+1, visited);
                visited[i-1] = false;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
